Native GUI app - GTK framwork


now i have TCP listener that starts in a thread and write anything it receives to a file


we can now read that file and respond to its messages

updates:

now i have a server that wrapes every stream into a client and handles them in separate threads

now i have two clients connected, but by input from console takes takes time, thus make my read_stream function to wait, thus it is missing most of the messages that are sent

maybe in implement a vect that holds ll the messages let to me
